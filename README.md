#### A Full Live-Scripted CAD Kernel and IDE in the Browser.

Use code to create 3D Models with features ranging from simple primitives + CSG to complex revolves, sweeps, and fillets.  Cascade Studio exposes the full power of the [OpenCascade](http://opencascade.com/) kernel, while providing a concise standard library for simple operations.

Save your completed models to .step, .stl. or .obj, or copy the url and share it with the community.

### Contributing

Cascade Studio is written entirely as static assets and vanilla javascript, so running it locally is as simple as running a server from the root directory (such as the [VS Code Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server), [Python live-server](https://pypi.org/project/live-server/), or [Node live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) ).

Pull Requests to this repo are automatically hosted to Vercel instances, so everyone will be able to test and benefit from your modifications immediately.
