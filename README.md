A Full Live-Scripted CAD Kernel and IDE in the Browser.

Use code to create 3D Models with features ranging from simple primitives + CSG to complex revolves, sweeps, and fillets.  Cascade Studio exposes the full power of the OpenCascade kernel, while providing a concise standard library for simple operations.

Save your completed models to .step, .stl. or .obj, or copy the url and share it with the community.
